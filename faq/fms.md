##What's new with FMS for 2015?

The network setup being tested for the 2015 system is a little bit different than the previous Control System. The new scheme utilizes mDNS to allow for the use of DHCP addressing and seamless transition from ethernet to USB and back.


mDNS



The FRC Driver Station, LabVIEW, and the Eclipse plugins for C++ and Java are all programmed to discover your roboRIO using the mDNS protocol. This means that the roboRIO can be detected regardless of the interface or IP being used.



mDNS - Principals



Multicast Domain Name System (mDNS) is a system which allows for resolution of host names to IP addresses on small networks with no dedicated name server. To resolve a host name a device sends out a multicast message to the network querying for the device. The device then responds with a multicast message containing it's IP. Devices on the network can store this information in a cache so subsequent requests for this address can be resolved from the cache without repeating the network query.



mDNS - Providers



To use mDNS, an mDNS implementation is required to be installed on your PC. Here are some common mDNS implementations for each major platform:

Windows:
덽I mDNS Responder - Installed with the NI FRC Update Suite
데pple Bonjour - Installed with iTunes

OSX:
데pple Bonjour - Installed by default

Linux:
뎙ss-mDNS/Avahi/Zeroconf - Installed and enabled by default on some Linux variants (such as Ubuntu or Mint). May need to be installed or enabled on others (such as Arch)



mDNS - Firewalls



To work properly mDNS must be allowed to pass through your firewall. Depending on your PC configuration, no changes may be required, this section is provided to assist with troubleshooting. Because the network traffic comes from the mDNS implementation and not directly from the Driver Station or IDE, allowing those applications through may not be sufficient. There are two main ways to resolve mDNS firewall issues:
데dd an application/service exception for the mDNS implementation (NI mDNS Responder is C:\Program Files\National Instruments\Shared\mDNS Responder\nimdnsResponder.exe)
데dd a port exception for traffic to/from UDP 5353 (IP ranges 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255   172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255   192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255   169.254.0.0-169.254.255.255   224.0.0.251)



mDNS - Browser support



Most web-browsers should be able to utilize the mDNS address to access the roboRIO webserver as long as an mDNS provider is installed. Please note the following exceptions:

Chrome - In Google Chrome, a trailing '/' must be appended to access mDNS addresses (eg.  roboRIO-190.local/)



USB



If using the USB interface, no setup is required. The roboRIO driver will automatically configure the IP address of the host (your computer) and roboRIO and the software listed above should be able to locate and utilize your roboRIO



Ethernet/Wireless



The 2015 Bridge Configuration Utility has been modified to enable the DHCP server on the DAP1522 radio in the home use case (AP mode), if you are putting the DAP1522 in bridge mode and using a router you can enable DHCP addressing on the router. The bridge is set to the same team based IP address as before (10.TE.AM.1) and will hand out DHCP address from 10.TE.AM.20 to 10.TE.AM.199

 



roboRIO Ethernet Configuration



The roboRIO Ethernet interface should be set to DHCP. When connected to the DAP1522 bridge, the roboRIO will receive an IP from the bridge. When tethered directly to a PC, both devices will self-assign IPs.



PC Adapter Configuration



When connecting via Ethernet (to either the radio or directly to the roboRIO) or Wireless (to the DLink radio), your computer adapter should be set to DHCP. When connecting through the DAP1522, your PC will receive an IP address from the radio. If tethered directly to the roboRIO both devices will self-assign IPs.



IP Lists



IPs for system components:

roboRIO USB: 172.22.11.2

roboRIO mDNS: roboRIO-####.local (where #### is your team number with no leading zeroes) You should be able to use this address to communicate with the roboRIO over either interface through ping, browser, etc.

Robot Radio: 10.TE.AM.1 (where TE.AM is your 4 digit team number with leading zeroes if required)

roboRIO Ethernet: DHCP, assigned by the Robot Radio

Driver Station PC: DHCP, assigned by the Robot Radio

Additional Programming computers: DHCP, assigned by the Robot Radio

DHCP range: 10.TE.AM.20 to 10.TE.AM.199

##Can I still stream images/Video to the Driver Station?
Yes, however remember the Link between the driverstation and the Robot is capped at 7 Mbits/second total. The Driverstation protocol uses roughly 900kbits/sec alone, leaving ~6Mb/s for any network tables, camera traffic, or any other data the team wishes to transmit over the WIFI network. As a Control Engineer, I would recommend teams ensure that at no time are they using more than 5Mb/s total (including DS packets) to maintain reliable connection. More information on FMS can be learned from the FMS whitepaper released by FIRST: [FMS Whitepaper](http://www.usfirst.org/sites/default/files/uploadedFiles/Robotics_Programs/FRC/Game_and_Season__Info/2013/FMSWhitePaper_RevA.pdf)

FIRST also released a FMS light program so teams can practice at home, with a similar FMS in the loop. However, FMS Lite is not FMS and there is no guarantee that your performance during tests will be mirrored during a competition.
