##What's new with FMS for 2015?
As far as we know as Alpha/Beta testers nothing besides usual first upgrades to make the network more reliable.

##Can I still stream images/Video to the Driver Station?
Yes, however remember the Link between the driverstation and the Robot is capped at 7 Mbits/second total. The Driverstation protocol uses roughly 900kbits/sec along, leaving 6Mb/s for any network tables, camera traffic, or any other data the team wishes to transmit over the WIFI network. As a Control Engineer, I would recommend teams ensure that at no time are they using more than 5Mb/s (including DS packets) to maintain reliable connection. More information on FMS can be learned from the FMS whitepaper released by FIRST: http://www.usfirst.org/sites/default/files/uploadedFiles/Robotics_Programs/FRC/Game_and_Season__Info/2013/FMSWhitePaper_RevA.pdf

FIRST also released a FMS light program so teams can practice at home, with a similar FMS in the loop. However, FMS Lite is not FMS and there is no guarantee that your performance during tests will be mirrored during a competition.
