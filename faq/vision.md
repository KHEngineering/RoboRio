##Can I use a USB Camera plugged into the RoboRio?
Yes, FIRST is providing official support for the HD3000 camera. Most other cameras should work out of the box if they work on *nix systems.

##Does OpenCV Run on the RoboRio?
Yes. The RoboRio is very similar to a beaglebone in terms of processor architecture. Instructions to get this running can be found here: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

##What performance can I expect when running Vision processing on the RoboRio?
This generally depends on which functions of OpenCV you wish to use. Some are more processor intensive than others. We stressed the RoboRio with the same vision code we ran in the 2014 season.
